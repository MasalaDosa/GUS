GUS, standing for 'Guess Sequences' is a program which deduces the underlying mathematical rule governing the next term of an integer sequence, given the existing members.
It is inspired by the program and article of the same name in the March 1987 edition of Acorn User Magazine by David Deutsch and David Jonnson-Davies.
